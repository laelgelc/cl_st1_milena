He doesn't just tend to plants; he listens to the silent echoes of lost things: a child's laughter trapped in a dropped marble, a soldier's sigh in a rusted button, the final chord of a song in a shattered violin string. His life is one of quiet, lonely stewardship until Rowan, a young carpenter fleeing a crushing personal loss, stumbles into Stillwater. Rowan's grief is a loud, tempestuous thing that disrupts the garden's delicate balance. But in that disruption, both men might find that some silences are meant to be broken, and some things are lost so they can be found again.Language:EnglishWords:6,304Chapters:8/8Hits:0

Short stories I've written for/about my DnD Character,  level 8+ Monk, certified chaos gremlin "Pan".
Honestly, this work has everything except actual explicit content. There's no telling what is actual canon in our home game and what isn't. This is the work where everything is made up and consistency doesn't matter.
The stories are ordered after when I wrote them, so connecting stories might not follow each other (looking at you Equadorius).

Her heart is set on the Citadel, where she intends to become an imperial scholar, provided she can survive five seasons in society until her brother comes of age.
She is ready to sail away from stifling traditions until she meets Sebastian Vexley. A Duke and a notorious rake, Sebastian is used to every lady's gaze and every lord’s envy. When he sets his sights on Eris, the "Diamond of the Season," he expects a quick conquest. But Eris has no interest in marriage or a man of his reputation. She is the first woman to ever say no to a Vexley, and she’s about to find out exactly why no one else ever does.

Summary
In the village of Stillwater, Elias Thorn is known as the odd groundskeeper of the forgotten memorial garden. He doesn't just tend to plants; he listens to the silent echoes of lost things: a child's laughter trapped in a dropped marble, a soldier's sigh in a rusted button, the final chord of a song in a shattered violin string. His life is one of quiet, lonely stewardship until Rowan, a young carpenter fleeing a crushing personal loss, stumbles into Stillwater. Rowan's grief is a loud, tempestuous thing that disrupts the garden's delicate balance. But in that disruption, both men might find that some silences are meant to be broken, and some things are lost so they can be found again.
